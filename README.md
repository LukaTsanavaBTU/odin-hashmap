# HashMap
Made for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-hashmap). The purpose of this project was to implement a hashmap using plain JavaScript. There are three files (and an extra file for testing): Node.js and LinkedList.js containing classes representing the nodes of a linked list and the linked list itself; HashMap.js containing a class representing the hashmap data structure. For the HashMap class, I've implemented several methods and properties:
- `hash(key)`: takes a key and produces a hash code with it;
- `set(key, value)`: takes two arguments, the first is a key and the second is a value that is assigned to this key. If a key already exists, then the old value is overwritten;
- `get(key)`: takes one argument as a key and returns the value that is assigned to this key. If a key is not found, return null;
- `has(key)`: takes a key as an argument and returns true or false based on whether or not the key is in the hash map;
- `remove(key)`: takes a key as an argument. If the given key is in the hash map, it should remove the entry with that key and return true. If the key isnâ€™t in the hash map, it should return false;
- `length()`: returns the number of stored keys in the hash map;
- `clear()`: removes all entries in the hash map;
- `keys()`: returns an array containing all the keys inside the hash map;
- `values()`: returns an array containing all the values;
- `entries()`: returns an array that contains each key, value pair. Example: `[[firstKey, firstValue], [secondKey, secondValue]]`;

The main goal of the project was to get some practice with data structures and with js.
